Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways cybercriminals break into personal and professional accounts. A strong password strategy is your first line of defense — and it’s easier to adopt than you might think.

Here are 5 essential rules to help you protect your online accounts:

1️⃣ Use a unique password for every account : 
Reusing passwords across platforms puts you at risk. If one gets exposed, all are compromised.

✅ Tool: Have I Been Pwned→ Check if your email or passwords have been part of a data breach.

2️⃣ Make it long & complex
A strong password should be at least 12 characters, including a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

🛠️ Tip: Avoid common substitutions like “@” for “a” — attackers know those tricks.

3️⃣ Use a password manager
Stop memorizing passwords. Let a secure manager generate and store them for you.

✅ Tools:

Bitwarden (free & open-source)
1Password
Dashlane

4️⃣ Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
Even if your password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from accessing your account.

✅ Tools:

Google Authenticator
Microsoft Authenticator

5️⃣ Update passwords regularly — and after any breach
Don’t wait for trouble. Change passwords periodically, especially on critical accounts (email, banking, work).

🧠 Bonus Tip: Sign up for breach alerts at Have I Been Pwned.

Following these rules helps protect your data, identity, and peace of mind.

Stay safe.
